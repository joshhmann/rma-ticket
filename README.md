# Rma Label Maker 
---
## What is this project?
At my current workplace, when we label parts to be returned back due to either needing refurbishing or testing,
its usually done by using a label maker, writing the ticket number down with masking tape or we dont use anything at all. There was one coworker who created 
a template that he prints out and writes the information by hand, so I thought I would take the next step to create a web version of it. I haven't done any testing yet
if it can work with a label printer, but that is the next step :)
